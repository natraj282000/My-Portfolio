  <h1>Banking and Finance</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I partnered with Access Microfinance Holdings, a Germany-based investment banking and financial services firm, as a freelance technical writer.
    I focused on documenting secure financial APIs and DevOps CI/CD workflows that support their banking and financial products.
    The API documentation primarily supports internal operations, including environmental and social management systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem Space & Business Needs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Needed robust API documentation to enable third-party integrations with their banking platforms.</li>
    <li>Internal developers and DevOps teams lacked comprehensive CI/CD pipeline documentation for environments like Azure and Kubernetes.</li>
    <li>Required simplified, client-facing documentation derived from highly technical engineering outputs to support business scalability and efficiency.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Role & Deliverables</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Created and maintained API references, DevOps documentation, and CI/CD runbooks using Markdown, Confluence, and GitHub.</li>
    <li>Authored detailed deployment guides for Azure-based infrastructure and Kubernetes clusters.</li>
    <li>Translated engineering release notes and complex technical content into clear, client-facing documents.</li>
    <li>Streamlined DevOps documentation workflows, reducing friction for developers and improving pipeline efficiency.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcomes & Business Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced developer onboarding time by 40% with well-structured documentation.</li>
    <li>Improved deployment accuracy and ensured security compliance through precise CI/CD process documentation.</li>
    <li>Enabled self-service for internal development teams and external partners, reducing reliance on engineering for operational tasks.</li>
  </ul>
